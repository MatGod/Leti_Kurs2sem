Suggestions
Watching 
From a post up high 
From where you see the ships afar 
From a well trained eye 
The waves all keep on crashing by 
If you are the light post 
Then you own the working class 
But if you want the answers 
Then you better give a piece of ass 
Warning 
Post hypnotic suggestions 
Running the ships ashore 
The orange light that follows 
Will soon proclaim itself God 
If you point your answers 
You better get ready for the fire 
Get ready for the fire 
The ships are multiplying day after day sir 
And they're coming close to the shore sir 
Shore sir 
We need to evacuate the light post 
It's all over, it's all over, it's all over.
